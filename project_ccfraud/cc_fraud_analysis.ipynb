        "\n",
        "In the current project, we will address the issue of credit card frauds, which is considered to be a form of identity theft. Typically, this type of fraud occurs from the illegal charging of purchases or funds removal from another's account due to unauthorised use of the person's credit card information<sup><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/credit_card_fraud\">1</a></sup>. This type of fraud is a major cause of concern in financial institutions and fintechs globally. According to the Nilson Report, credit card fraud worldwide led to the loss of $28.58 billion in 2020<sup><a href=\"https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1515/1link/\">2</a></sup>.\n",

        "\n",
        "Thus, credit card frauds are greatly relevant due to their potential to considerably harm both costumers and financial institutions. Another factor to be taken into account are the action to preventively block a credit card due to suspicious activity. If the transaction is genuine, this causes both stress and embarassment to the clients who are denied their purchase.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the aforementioned reasons, investments in Fraud Detection through Artificial Inteligence are increasing constantly, presenting as a great Data Science oportunity. Slightly better machine learning algorithms, with great volumes of data as a base, already represent millions in economy through fraud avoidance."

These **principal components** correspond to a linear combination of the original variables and their goal is to encapsulate most of the variation present in the dataset<sup><a href=\"http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials/\">4</a></sup>.\n",
