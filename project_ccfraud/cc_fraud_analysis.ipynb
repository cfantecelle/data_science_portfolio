        "\n",
        "In the current project, we will address the issue of credit card frauds, which is considered to be a form of identity theft. Typically, this type of fraud occurs from the illegal charging of purchases or funds removal from another's account due to unauthorised use of the person's credit card information<sup><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/credit_card_fraud\">1</a></sup>. This type of fraud is a major cause of concern in financial institutions and fintechs globally. According to the Nilson Report, credit card fraud worldwide led to the loss of $28.58 billion in 2020<sup><a href=\"https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1515/1link/\">2</a></sup>.\n",

        "\n",
        "Thus, credit card frauds are greatly relevant due to their potential to considerably harm both costumers and financial institutions. Another factor to be taken into account are the action to preventively block a credit card due to suspicious activity. If the transaction is genuine, this causes both stress and embarassment to the clients who are denied their purchase.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the aforementioned reasons, investments in Fraud Detection through Artificial Inteligence are increasing constantly, presenting as a great Data Science oportunity. Slightly better machine learning algorithms, with great volumes of data as a base, already represent millions in economy through fraud avoidance."

These **principal components** correspond to a linear combination of the original variables and their goal is to encapsulate most of the variation present in the dataset<sup><a href=\"http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials/\">4</a></sup>.\n",

For this reason, due to the [*Accuracy Paradox*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox), measuring the accuracy of the model alone is not a good metric to evaluate our model. As such, we will also be looking at *precision*, *recall* and something known as the [AUC - ROC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc), or **A**rea **U**nder the **C**urve of the **R**eceiver **O**perating **C**haracteristic curve. This type of measure takes into account the True Positive Rate and the False Positive Rate, which means it considers both the classes in its evaluation.\n",

        "As for the **AUC**, it is the calculation of the area under a ROC curve (which is a probability curve). A ROC curve plots the *sensitivity* (true positives rate) against *1 - Specificity* (false positives rate). The higher the area under the curve (i.e. the closer to 1 the value is), the better our model is at distinguishing the classes (fraud from normal transactions).\n",

        "We can gather a lot of information from these KPIs. In terms of what would be an ideal setting to prevent credit card fraud, one would imagine that three points should be considered like it was mentioned early on:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prevention of actual frauds (leading to lower loss of money).\n",
        "2. The blocking of authentic transactions (leading to higher inconvenience for costumers).\n",

Last, but not least, we would want to prevent as much money loss as possible.\n",

This is not an exarcebated rates of decline, but these must be aligned beforehand with the business goals."

        "\n",
        "Here, we executed a basic analysis by using (mostly) default parameters in both machine learning classification models, the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers. However, we also compared how both models deal with unbalanced data.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for our data, we could see that there are two apparent peaks in time where the frauds occur. These peaks could be related to specific hours of the day, such as nighttime, that could provide some aditional information for our model. However, we cannot infer the time of day from the provided data as it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regarding our classifications, in the validation phase, we saw that the Random Forest classifier yielded better results. When we classified our test data, we found that the Logistic Regression had better results, especially by reaching over 90% precision with a balanced dataset. Nonetheless, both models had good AUROC results, and were regarded as good models to distinguish correctly between fraudulent and normal transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we analysed the KPIs for our model, we saw that the gain in fraud prevention (higher recall rates) for the balanced models was more expressive (as it is more important) than the increase in blocking of good transactions (lower precision rates). This is reflected in how much money loss the models were able to prevent, especially the (balanced) Logistic Regression, which had a higher prevention result.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also observe the effect that class proportions have in the training phase of our dataset. It has been demonstrated that the Random Forest classifier provides better results when dealing with unbalanced datasets when compared to the Logistic Regression, especially by reaching higher recall rates concomitantly with high precision rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these good results, further improvement can and should be made in these models. In the future, it is important to check and fine-tune these models by changing their hyperparameters appropriately, aiming to keep recall rates high while also increasing precision rates whenever possible."
