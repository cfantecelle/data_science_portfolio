        "# Predicting Health Insurance costs\n",
        "\n",
        "When acquiring Health Insurance, it is common that the we pay a fixed and low amount of money, in return to being covered by the insurance over a high amount of charges during a moment of healthcare need or emergency. Given this fact, is important for insurance companies to predict the cost of customers in case such an event arises, so that their business is still feasible. This is a difficult issue, because it is hard to predict when and how someone will become ill. However, certain aspects of people's behaviour, habits and medical history might be able to tell us how much these patients will cost for the insurance company.\n",

However, historically the BMI and the categories defined by it have been associate to negative health conditions. Thus, here we will classify the data according to the [BMI standards](https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/fact-sheets/item/a-healthy-lifestyle---who-recommendations) and we will compare how this measurement influences our predictions."
