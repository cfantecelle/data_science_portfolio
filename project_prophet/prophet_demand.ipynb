        "# Wine demand prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Wine is, without a doubt, one of the most popular alcoholic beverages in the world. Although scientists are still unsure about the benefits of wine, the idea that having \"one glass of wine a day\" can help prevent heart attacks is somewhat widespread in society<sup><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281\">1</a></sup>. Moreover, the wine industry was one of the many things the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on, with wine sales (especially online) spiking over 500% at the peak period of lockdown in April 2020<sup><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2021/06/22/how-post-pandemic-wine-consumption-trends-are-shaping--demand/\">2</a></sup>. Without such an atypical reason for this rise sales, specialized wine stores might be able to predict their sales demand given that they have enough data on their sales over time.\n",

        "</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "Such a representation of data is called a Time Series, and reflects a specific sequence of values measured along successive evenly spaced time points<sup><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\">3</a></sup>. Predictions on Time Series — called **Time Series Forecasting** — is a form of *extrapolating* values in the future by leveraging previous data of interest and requires a specific methodology.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will be predicting wine sales demand using [Facebook's Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). Similar to PyCaret, Prophet is a low-code library that provides a strategy for working with time series forecasting based on an additive model that even takes into consideration holiday effects. It is also robust to missing data points and trend shifts, as well as able to handle outliers<sup><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/prophet/\">4</a></sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Demand forecasting and why it is important\n",
        "\n",
        "**Demand forecasting** is, essentially, predicting the demand for products/materials that meet the company's needs, allowing for the maintenance of an optimal profit margin. It is constructed upon studying patterns in market dynamics, cause-effect relationships and trends of sales. And because changes constantly affect businesses, demand prediction becomes important from them<sup><a href=\"https://startup.info/why-demand-forecasting-is-important/\">5</a></sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several factors can determine demand<sup><a href=\"https://byjus.com/commerce/demand/\">6, such as the product costs, the consumers' incomes, the cost of related goods and services, consumer expectations well as the number of buyers in the market. All of these can be taken into account when trying to understand a particular product's demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, **demand planning** is the process in which the business prepares itself for the *foreseeable* future, based on the forecast being made. With this, companies are able to stimulate consumer demand while also allowing the company to effectively meet the growing demand<sup><a href=\"https://startup.info/why-demand-forecasting-is-important/\">5</a></sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several benefits to be gained from time-series forecasting:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Price setting:** Predicting product popularity (or a lack thereof) allows for price adjustment (and setting up sales) which can have a great impact on revenue.\n",
        "* **Budget:** Forecasting demand allows you to estimate the company budget, enabling you to reduce risk and make financial decisions, such as reallocating resources.\n",
        "* **Improved supply infrastructure**: Knowing the business' demands allows for better control of inventory, of personnel needed.\n",
        "* **Reducing uncertainty**: Uncertainty makes decision-making much more difficult, and knowing what to expect can reduce this impact and allow better planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have discussed this, let's dive in.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in the project today was a synthetic dataset created by Rafael at [Sigmoidal](https://sigmoidal.ai). It consists of a dataset from Kaggle which was modified to have 3 years of daily sales, distributed by 3 stores and 219 different products (modified from 5 years of daily sales, from 10 stores and 50 products). \n",
        "\n",
        "The products, though, are real and based on a real e-commerce offer of wines. Names, crops and prices are 100% real (in BRL and converted to USD). Some of the products might have appeared in the real market after a given start in sales for that product (for example, a wine from a 2015 crop started being sold in 2013, which makes no sense), but this is just the artifact of this artificial dataset. This might also be reflected in other unexpected characteristics like the trend in sales for a wine that is not very popular, for example.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the products sheet, we will have the following variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **item_id** = Item identification number.\n",
        "* **name** = Name of the Wine.\n",
        "* **producer** = Name of the Wine producer.\n",
        "* **country** = Country of origin.\n",
        "* **vintage** = The wine's vintage/harvest.\n",
        "* **kind** = The type of wine.\n",
        "* **price_brl** = Price in Brazilian Reais.\n",
        "* **price_usd** = Price in US dollars.\n",
        "\n",
        "While from the sales data we will have:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **date** = The date of sale.\n",
        "* **store** = The store that sold the item.\n",
        "* **item** = The item that was sold.\n",
        "* **sales** = The number of said items that were sold.\n",
