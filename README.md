# Carlos Henrique Fantecelle
<sup>*Data Scientist* and *Researcher* at Center of Infectious Diseases (Federal University of Espírito Santo)</sup>

<br>

With experience in Science and Research, especially in the immunology field, I look at data in a wide perspective, being able to see small details and also think about the higher picture. With thoroughness and the ability to identify patterns, I have been applying my knowledge into understanding real life problems, mainly related to human health. Recently, I also started developing skill towards analysing and understanding other kinds of data.

<br>

I have a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES) where I also studied for one year at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). I also have a Master's Degree in Infectious Diseases from UFES and I am currently doing a PhD in the same area and institution.

<br>

**My background includes:** R, Python, Molecular Biology, Transcriptomics and Research in Infection and Immunity.
