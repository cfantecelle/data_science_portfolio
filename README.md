# Carlos Henrique Fantecelle
<sup>*Data Scientist*, *Researcher* and *Ph.D. student* at the Center of Infectious Diseases (Federal University of Espírito Santo)</sup>

<br>

With experience in Science and Research, especially in the immunology field, I look at data from a wide perspective, going from the higher picture to the small details. With thoroughness and the ability to identify patterns, I have been applying my knowledge to understand real-life problems, mainly related to human health. Recently, I also started developing skills analyzing and understanding other kinds of data.

<br>

I have a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES) where I also studied for one year at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). I also have a Master's Degree in Infectious Diseases from UFES and I am currently doing a Ph.D. in the same area and institution.

<br>

**My background includes:** R, Python, Molecular Biology, Transcriptomics and Research in Infection and Immunity.
